#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects,I have converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I have got a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Key Features!
- Offline Feature (Service Worker)
    1. At the first page load, All of the content will go to service worker section.
    2. When users visit any page then that page content will automatically go to the service worker section.
    3. If Users want to visit any page, which wasn't visited when users were online. Then the browser will redirect to the offline page. 
- Accessibility part
    1. Used Alt Attribute for all Images.
    2. Used **Aria Role** Property, **tabindex** property.
    3. Make All colors responsive for a11y.
- Responsiveness Part.
    1. Made all pictures responsiveness
    2. Used **srcset**, **sizes** attributes for Different width.
    3. Used `CSS Grid` and `CSS Flexbox` for dynamic layout.
- All of js code done with `ES6`.
- Cool Favicon Icon.



### How to Run Project Locally

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

```javascript
With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8080
```
